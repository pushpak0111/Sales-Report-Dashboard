# Sales-Report-Dashboard
Created an interactive Sales Dashboard using Power BI to visualize and analyze 12 months of sales data. The dashboard includes key KPIs such as Total Sales Amount, Profit, Quantity Sold, and Average Order Value. It features dynamic visualizations like Profit by State and Sub-Category, Quantity by Category and Payment Mode, Monthly Profit Trends, and Customer-wise Sales. Built-in slicers allow users to filter data by state and quarter, enabling deep insights into regional and seasonal performance.
